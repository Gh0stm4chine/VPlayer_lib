# VPlayer Library (0.3.2)
This project provides the easiest way to include FFmpeg into any Android project with almost no NDK building and tweaking.
Of course if you want to customize FFmpeg, you will have to build the project from scratch.

Forked from [appunite/AndroidFFmpeg](https://github.com/appunite/AndroidFFmpeg), this project has a few enhancements to make it
easier to develop and embed videos to your app. I have added some more functionality and a new simple project for
developers to get started with. This project follows AndroidFFmpeg closely.

Read the wikis for this work. Even if you are a beginner to NDK, this project should be comprehensable enough to include 
VPlayer into your project. I provide prebuilt binaries for the project.

## Changes/Fixes from AndroidFFmpeg

- Able to compile with gcc 4.9+ toolchain and NDK r10e (32 or 64bit)
- Updated with the newest versions of each library
- Super easy way to compile FFmpeg from scratch without hassles
- Fixes crashing issue when using the same video player for multiple videos (with or without subs)
- Added a single build file to compile all dependencies without any need of commandline
- Changed the Java library to easily integrate a video into a project
- Added looping functionality

## Sample integration

This is a very simple example that plays a video after starting the activity.
You can view more integration tutorials [here](https://github.com/matthewn4444/VPlayer_lib/wiki/Integration-Tutorial).

    public class VideoActivity extends Activity {
        private VPlayerView mPlayerView;

        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

            // Attach the player
            mPlayerView = new VPlayerView(this);
            setContentView(mPlayerView);

            // Set the content and play the video
            mPlayerView.setDataSource(path);
            mPlayerView.play();
        }

        @Override
        protected void onPause() {
            super.onPause();
            mPlayerView.onPause();
        }

        @Override
        protected void onResume() {
            super.onResume();
            mPlayerView.onResume();
        }

        @Override
        public void finish() {
            super.finish();
            mPlayerView.finish();
        }
    }
